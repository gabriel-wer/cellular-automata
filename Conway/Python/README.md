### NOTES
If you just run the program normally, the cells are generated automagically using randomInts (0, 1)

If you set the flag '-e' or '--empty' the program will start with an empty array and you can draw on it and press space when you're finished

### COMMANDS
```bash
-e or --empty = Starts with an empty canvas
-c or --columns = Set the starting number of columns
-r or --rows = Set the starting number of rows
-cs or --cell= Set the starting cell size

```
